//Messi goals function
//Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:

//LaLiga
//Copa del Rey
//Champions.
//Complete the goals function to return his total goals (the sum) for all three leagues.

//Note: the parameter for this function will always be a valid number.

//Ex :

//goals(5,10,2) == 5+10+2 = 17
//Test.assertEquals(goals(0,0,0), 0)
//Test.assertEquals(goals(43, 10, 5), 58)

const goals = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
